This model is based on the one published in [ROBOTIS-OP2-Common](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/ROBOTIS-OP2-Common).

The meshes for physics parameters and collision computation are based on HumaRobotics' [darwin_description](https://github.com/HumaRobotics/darwin_description).

The modifications for the simulation model are as follows
+ File format.
+ Low-poly body mesh
+ Physics parameters
